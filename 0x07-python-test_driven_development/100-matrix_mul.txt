Not just any list - they *must* be lists of lists!

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: m_a must be a list of lists

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [3, 4]))

And not just any list of lists - they *must* be lists of lists containing
integers or floats!

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, "non-number"]], [[3, 4]]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: m_a should contain only integers or floats

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[{"a": 1}, 8.8]]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: m_b should contain only integers or floats

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, "non-number"]], [[{"a": 1}, 8.8]]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: m_a should contain only integers or floats

Finally, the length of all rows in matrices ``m_a`` and ``m_b`` should be
equivalent. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.

    >>> m_a = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [3, 4, 5]
    ... ]
    >>> m_b = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [3, 4]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: each row of m_a must should be of the same size

::

    >>> m_a = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [3, 4]
    ... ]
    >>> m_b = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [3, 4, 5]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: each row of m_b must should be of the same size

::

    >>> m_a = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [3, 4, 5]
    ... ]
    >>> m_b = m_a
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: each row of m_a must should be of the same size
